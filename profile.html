      <h1>About Me<br></h1>
        <h2>～Where Math, Music, and Art Intersect～</h2><br>
  
      <h2>Optimization Through the Lens of Dynamics</h2>
      
      <p>I am a PhD student studying <b>optimization algorithms.</b><br>
        My research focuses on proposigning and analyzing optimization algorithms through the lens of <b>dynamical systems</b>, with applications in machine learning and beyond.<br>
        Before stepping into the world of optimization, I studied <b>numerical analysis</b>, particularly numerical relativity—the field of solving Einstein’s equations computationally.
        This equation is a nonlinear partial differential equation with <b>constraints</b>, and due to their strong nonlinearity, simulating it over long time scales presents significant challenges in terms of stability and accuracy.
         This led me to study how to correct the numerical instability of differential equations with constraints, especially conservation-type constraints.<br>   
        From there, my interest naturally extended to constrained <b>continuous optimization</b> problems from a </b>dynamical perspective</b>.
      In fact, several optimization methods are known to be equivalent to discretizations of continuous-time dynamical systems, and I think analyzing them from this perspective offers various advantages.<br>
    One of the key benefits is that it allows us to <b>relax the strict assumptions</b> often imposed on the objective function in classical analysis. 
      By choosing appropriate discretization schemes for the underlying differential equations, we can, for instance, propose algorithms that are <b>faster</b> or <b>better suited to real-world applications</b>.<br>
Through this line of research, I hope to contribute not only to the theoretical development of algorithmic theory and numerical analysis, but also to practical applications—such as AI technologies (...where formulating the task of fitting models to data as an optimization problem is precisely what machine learning entails), as well as signal processing and related fields.
         </p>

      <h2>Why mathematics?</h2>
      <p>I was drawn to mathematics from a young age through analogies I sensed between music and math.<br>
One of the most profound inspirations for me was encountering The Riemann zeta function :<br>
        <p>
  \( \zeta(x) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^x} \)
</p>

<p>
  And This series diverges when \( x = 1 \) and is called <b>"harmonic series"</b>:<br>
  \[
    \zeta(1) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n}
  \]
</p>
  
 In musical terms, this corresponds to the fundamental tone and its infinite sum of overtones (or harmonics).
<b>Pythagoras</b> explored the relationship between string length and pitch using simple experiments—such as striking water-filled vessels—and discovered that simple <b>integer ratios</b> produce harmonically pleasing intervals. 
      This led to the theoretical foundation of what we now call the <b>Pythagorean scale</b>, and the word <b>"harmonic"</b> itself originates from these musical insights.is called <b>"harmonic series"</b><br>

In mathematics, too, we encounter concepts like <b>harmonic functions</b> and <b>harmonic analysis</b>, which are deeply rooted in the study of oscillations and resonance.<br>
This elegant connection between music and mathematics is what first pulled me toward pure math.

    <h2>Bridging Music, Mathematics, and Art</h2>
    <p>
      Outside of research, I play the violin and create generative art using code.
I paint with code, drawing abstract colors and geometric patterns from music.<br>

I’ve also grown increasingly interested in the evolution of 20th-century Western music—from Schoenberg’s twelve-tone technique to aleatoric music and Xenakis’s mathematically inspired compositions. 
      This progression from determinism to chance echoes the shif seen in the sciences from deterministic to probabilistic paradigms. I find this parallel deeply fascinating.<br>

Lately, I’ve been reading philosophy of science and philosophy of music. Both seem to circle back toward the roots of the liberal arts and philosophy—something I feel strongly drawn to.<br>

My dream is to carry out truly interdisciplinary research at the intersection of mathematics, music, and art.
For example, I hope to apply my own optimization algorithms to signal processing not only for practical problem-solving, but also to generate abstract visual works. <br>
I’m curious whether mathematics might one day offer insight into the perceptual bridge between sound and color—the very heart of my artistic inspiration.
